Program for solving math expressions

This is an app, which can solve math expressions. You can use addition, substracion, multiplication, division and power operands (all with real values).
It also parses expressions in brackets and do the right order of operations if they're in brackets.

Also you can use these functions:
1. sin(x)
2. cos(x)
3. ln(x)
4. exp(x)
5. qbrt(x) - cubic root
6. sqrt(x) - square root
7. tg(x)
8. ctg(x)
9. arcsin(x)
10. arccos(x)
11. arctg(x)
12. abs(x)
13. round(x)

And there are such constants: pi, e, phi

Unfortunateley it does not support operands priority, so if there are no brackets, it'll do addition before multiplication if it is written before.
